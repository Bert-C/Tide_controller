Arduino ports:

B: digital pin 8 to 13, covered by PCINT0
C: analog input pins, 	covered by PCINT1
D: digital pins 0 to 7, covered by PCINT2

SoftwareSerial and PololuWheelEncoders clash with each other in their 
stock forms because they both try to set up pin change interrupts on 
all three ports of the Arduino. To make these two libraries play nice
together, you need to modify both to use separate ports. For both 
libraries, I made a copy of the original library folder, renamed it,
and placed the new folder in Arduino/libraries/
Inside each folder, I changed the name of the .cpp and .h files to add
the 'my' to the start of each to differentiate them from the original
libraries. 

There are no changes made to the code inside mySoftwareSerial.h.
 
Inside mySoftwareSerial.cpp, two sets of changes need to be made.
Near the top of the .cpp file (line 44), change the line
#include "SoftwareSerial.h" 

to read
#include "mySoftwareSerial.h"

Further down in the .cpp file, make the 2nd set of changes. Comment 
out the lines:

/*
#if defined(PCINT1_vect)
ISR(PCINT1_vect)
{
  SoftwareSerial::handle_interrupt();
}
#endif

#if defined(PCINT2_vect)
ISR(PCINT2_vect)
{
  SoftwareSerial::handle_interrupt();
}
#endif

#if defined(PCINT3_vect)
ISR(PCINT3_vect)
{
  SoftwareSerial::handle_interrupt();
}
#endif
*/

so that mySoftwareSerial doesn't interfere with other routines trying to
use pin change interrupts on ports C and D. mySoftwareSerial retains use 
of pin change interrupts on port B (digital pins 8-13).
This leaves ports C and D available for routines like the PololuWheelEncoders.

The myPololuWheelEncoders.h file does not need to be modified (except for 
having its name changed).

In the PololuWheelEncoders.cpp file, near the top (line 29), the line
#include "PololuWheelEncoders.h"

should be changed to read
#include "myPololuWheelEncoders.h"

Further down in the code of the file, the line
ISR(PCINT0_vect) 
should be changed to read ISR(PNINT2_vect), and the two lines

ISR(PCINT1_vect,ISR_ALIASOF(PCINT0_vect));
ISR(PCINT2_vect,ISR_ALIASOF(PCINT0_vect));

below that should be commented out. This will make it so that the encoder
functions only work on digital lines 0-7 (Arduino PortB).
